### What I learned

At the start on doing this project, I don't know how to setup the black shadow behind the card. I knew it was box-shaodow property but I didn't know how to do it. Thanks to [mdn web docs.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) now I know how to set the box shadow and adjust the value according to the design example.
